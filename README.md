# mastermind-game
The popular mastermind guessing game simulated programatically. You initially enter a sequence of 4 colors in order and you get guesses to determine the sequence of the colors. The hint you get back is the feedback where you are told how many colors are correct but in wrong position and how many are in the right position.
